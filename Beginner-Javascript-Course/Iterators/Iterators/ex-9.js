methods
in this lesson as well as how to use the JavaScript documentation from the Mozilla Developer Network to discover and understand additional methods. Letâ€™s review!

    .forEach()
    is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined.

    .map()
    executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.

    .filter()
    checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
    Preview: Docs Returns the first index that passes the callback function's test. Returns -1 if no element passes the test.
    .findIndex()
    returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns -1 if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.

    .reduce()
    iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.
    All iterator methods take a callback function, which can be a pre-defined function, a function expression, or an arrow function.
    You can visit the Mozilla Developer Network to learn more about iterator methods (and all other parts of JavaScript!).
